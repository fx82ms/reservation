Ivr with node-ari

Introduction

The Asterisk RESTful Interface (ARI) is a new interface to Asterisk that was released with Asterisk 12 and lets you build external applications.The state of the objects being controlled by the user are conveyed via JSON events over a WebSocket.

node-ari-client is Node.js client library for the Asterisk REST Interface. It builds upon the swagger-js library, providing an improved, Asterisk-specific API over the API generated by swagger-js.

IVRAN is a general purpose application using node-ari-client for Interactive voice response.
